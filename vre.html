<h1>Visitor Research and Evaluation</h1>
<h2>What is the purpose of doing an evaluation?</h2>
- it is only one voice in the decision making
- front-end is used for planning 
before anything i s built. What do people care about? what are some hot topics?
- formative is used for prototyping
what works? what doesn't? developers don't really like this phase
- Summative is after installation
Did the project work or not? This is what people usually think evaluation is. Usually a report goes to the funders
