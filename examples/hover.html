    <h3>How does this work?</h3>
    <p>Notice this line:</p>
    <code>.hover-container:hover .hover-target {</code>
    <p>This is a complicated CSS selector. <code>:hover</code> is a 
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes" target="_blank">pseudo-class</a>, which is,
      in short, a class that is automtically assigned by the browser. In this case, it is when an
      element is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:hover" target="_blank">hovered.</a>.
    </p>
    <p>When two CSS selectros are written on after the other, without space between them, the rule applies to 
      all elements that qualify to <em>both</em> selectors. So <code>.hover-container:hover</code>
      means "all elements that are of the class <code>.hover-container</code> <em>and</em> are currently hovered". 
    </p>
    <p>When two CSS selectros are written on after the other <em>with</em> a space between them,
     that is called a "<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Descendant_combinator" target="_blank">descendant combinator</a>", which means that 
    the rule applies to elements that qualify to the second selector <em>if</em>
    they are within an element that qualify to the first selector. Example:</p>
    <code>.parent-class p</code> 
    <p>will apply to <code>p</code> elements that are with in an element of ths class <code>parent-class</code>
    <p>So this line:</p>
    <code>.hover-container:hover .hover-target</code>
    <p>means: "all elements of the class <code>.hover-target</code> that are
    within an element of the class <code>.hover-container</code> which is currently hovered</p>
    <p>If we now look at the rest of the CSS code, we see that the <code>.hover-target</code> class
    has a <code>display: none</code> property, but if the <code>.hover-container</code>, which contains is,
    is hovered, then the display becomes <code>block</code>, and the element appears. It has a 
    <code>position: absolute</code>property, so it shows exactly where we tell it
    to, without interfering with the rest of the page. Notice that 
    you have to give the contianer, in this case <code>.hover-container</code>,
    a <code>position: relative</code> propery.</p>
